# üõ†Ô∏è Mini Tools for Data Analysis

**Mini Tools**, a collection of lightweight and handy Python scripts and notebooks designed to simplify common data analysis tasks. These tools are particularly helpful for quick data wrangling, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis in genomics, bioinformatics, and general-purpose data science workflows.

## üìÇ Contents

Each script in this repository is modular and easy to use. Below are the currently included tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SARS-CoV-2-condional_unassigned.*` | Extract and filter unassigned reads in SARS-CoV-2 datasets based on specific conditions. |
| `extract_specific_rows.*` | Retrieve rows from a DataFrame based on keyword or condition match. |
| `match_unmatch.*` | Compare two datasets and find matched/unmatched entries. |
| `subsample.*` | SARS-CoV-2 subsample a dataset for analysis and phylogenetic tree data preparation |
| `two_dataframe_join_column_wise.*` | Join two DataFrames column-wise (side-by-side). |
| `two_dataframe_join_row_wise.*` | Join two DataFrames row-wise (stacked). |

## üöÄ Getting Started
